List and description of files
=============================

---Helper Classes/modules
littleData.py			--> define reader & data object for "littleData modules"
cspad.py			--> wrapper for CsPad geometry & calibration access
azimuthalAveraging.py		--> class to do azimuthalAveraging (e.g. for CsPad). Includes physics corrections
utilities.py			--> various helper classes that do not *yet) deserve their own file


--- modules to be (possibly) run before your example analysis
xpp_littleDat.py		--> writes files with "small" data into ftc directory. 
					Attaches small data object to event to be used later to 
					isolate naming convention & changes as well as possible 
					standard pre-analysis (not yet)
--- modules for example analysis
xpp_anaRad.py			--> attach CsPad integral & azimuthal Av to event, to be written out 
					in hdf5 translation step if so desired
					(not using "littleData" yet)
xpp_cspadMovie.py		--> save a npy file with cspad images in time bins. Uses little Data
xpp_findpeak.py			--> not written yet. Idea was to automatize peak finding when 
					the signal region moves
xpp_makeDarkMask.py		--> makes npy files with pedestals and masks for "integrated" darks 
					(using off shots in the run)
xpp_peak.py			--> look at peak intensity on cs140k / calib; not littleData
xpp_peak_tt.py			--> look at peak intensity on cs140k tt binned; not littleData
xpp_sokaras.py			--> code for first sokaras expt.; not littleData
xpp_sokaras_mpi.py		--> code for first sokaras expt w/ mpi; not littleData
xpp_step.py


---non-standard named modules for full analysis
AreaDet_OnOffScan.py		--> On v Off histograms of a peak on the cspad 140k
frame_reco_calib.py
emission.py			--> von Hamos spectrum on a cspad 140 for xray on shots
