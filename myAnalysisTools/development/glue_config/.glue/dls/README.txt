brain storm (then order)





4) getting it to working demo mode for scientists
	1)(check) choosing what to plot without changing code.  dig into the API 
	2) implement wiener filtering
	3) (on deck) optimized back end for fast re-calculating of large statistics.  Avoid recalculating mean, slope, etc from scratch...  efficient caching method?
	4) (check) modulation spectroscopy approach.  Is this a beneficial approach?
	

3) scikit.beam binned_statistic is more efficient. is that compatible with the vectorized version?

5) demo psana shared memory compatibility
