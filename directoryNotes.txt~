#Damiani triage notes
#hutch daq devices multicast over udp to mon and dss nodes.
#the dss nodes are the final stop on the daq. 
#psana copies ffb to the cloud lustre system.
#next is the lustre filesystem.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustre_(file_system)

#if machine doesn't ping on reboot. call ernesto cause pspxe is not sending boot, 

#if usb encoders read daq damage, then power cycle them.  same applies to acqiris
#they don't have ipmi, but the do have the I-Boot bar that's on the edm screen

#if nothing on dss node under u2, than pcds-it-l

#can't open /dev/edt (engineering design team?)
#edt won't appear in lspci
#frame grabber problem.  turn off computer for 30 seconds and then turn on.

#pnccd cards come lose during rack motion.  Just need reseating

#problem with pnccd ioc, call mike browne

#problem with DAQ cam?  check usb ports with ls usb
