# Configuration file for LJE-YANO scan
# The configuration file is divided into several sections, each with
# its own settings
#  SCAN : Scan settings
#    fel_mode :  SEEDED or SASE or SEEDED SASE  
#                Set to whether FEL is running in SASE, SEEDED, or SEEDED SASE 
#       laser :  TRUE or FALSE
#                When TRUE, record data with Fiber laser close/open per
#                energy point
#
#  SEEDED : Seeded scan settings
#    Scan proceeds from 'scan_start' to 'scan_stop' in 'scan_step' steps
#    scan_start: starting energy of scan
#     scan_stop: stop value of scan
#    scan_steps: number of scan points 
#
#    ctrl_pv : PV that sets the SEEDED beam energy
#     rbv_pv : PV that signals when FEL has finished moving to new energy
#   rbv_done : Value rbv_pv has when finsihed moving to new energy
#
#  SASE : SASE scan settings
#    Scan proceeds from 'scan_start' to 'scan_stop' in 'scan_step' steps
#    scan_start: starting energy of scan
#     scan_stop: stop value of scan
#    scan_steps: number of scan points 
#
#    ctrl_pv : PV that sets the SASE beam energy
#     rbv_pv : PV that signals when FEL has finished moving to new energy
#   rbv_done : Value rbv_pv has when finsihed moving to new energy
#
#  MONO : Mono calibration parameters
#    Record Mono grating position at low,medium, and high FEL energies
#    LowMachine  : Low FEL Energy
#    LowGrating  : Mono Grating at low FEL Energy
#
#    MidMachine  : Medium FEL Energy
#    MidGrating  : Mono Grating at medium FEL Energy
#
#    HighMachine : High FEL Energy
#    HighGrating : Mono Grating at high FEL Energy#  
#
#
#  ANDOR : Andor camera settings
#   integration: Exposure (integration) time in seconds
#       readout: Readout time of Andor camera in seconds. 
#                Use for staggered Andor readout
#      simmode : TRUE or FALSE
#                When TRUE, scan simulated BURST mode is used
#   
#      expdelay: SEE TOMY'S ORIGNAL CODE 
#     postdelay: SEE TOMY'S ORIGNAL CODE 
#     opendelay: SEE TOMY'S ORIGNAL CODE 
#
#  LASER: Laser settings
#    laser_wait: Time in seconds, after shutter opens/closes, until
#                jet is (not) illuminated 
#     laser1 : TRUE or FALSE 
#               When TRUE, fiber laser shutter 1 opens/closes
#     laser2 : TRUE or FALSE 
#               When TRUE, fiber laser shutter 2 opens/closes
#     laser3 : TRUE or FALSE 
#               When TRUE, fiber laser shutter 3 opens/closes
#
#
# ANALYSIS : PVs that contain the scan parameters. Used by online
#            PSANA analysis  
#   scan_start_pv : PV that stores the starting value of scan
#   scan_stop_pv  : PV that stores the end value of the scan
#   scan_steps_pv : PV that stores the number of scan points
#   fel_mode_pv   : PV that states whether we are in SASE or SEEDED mode
#
