mono_autotune.py
- First version of autotune script

mono_autotune_allshots
- Capture 10 frame from EXS_OPAL, then sum, project and calculate
  sharpness 
- Assumes mono in first order

mono_autotune_firstorder
- Collects 200 horizontal projections.
  During acquisition, FEE Gas Detector is monitored for dropped shots.
  If FEL fails to lase, process to collect projects restarts.
  If happens more than 10 times, scripts stops and alerts users.

mono_autotune_zero_order
- Collects 200 images and monitors FEE Gas Detector values for dropped
  shots. If FEL fails to lase, acquisition restarts.
  If this happens more than 10 times, scripts stops and alerts users.
- Maybe better for script to collect projections rather than averaged
  image.

ss_measure
- Calculates width from FEL soft x-ray self-seeding
- Needs to be integrated with general fitting code to optimise mirror
  focus. 

Nexst steps are to combine the scripts in one larger script than can
do mono zero, first, and SXRSS. 
- must allow different algorithms that measure quality of focus to be
  integrated 
- must work for optimizing minimumn or maximum
- know whether mono is in zero or first order, and then make
  corrections

...futher down the line
- automatically tune mirrror to get beam in center
- define its own scan range. 
  - a more general gradient descent/ascent algoritm a la MINUIT would
    be needed. 



mono_autofocus


TO-DO:
- mono_autofocus
  - set colour and add legend
  - allow errors to be plotted 
  - print fit params to final fit

- mono_autofocus_zeroorder
  - allow option of parsing a config file 
  - switch for simulation mode              
  - set colour and add legend
  - set axes titles and units
  - allow errors to be plotted 
  - propagate errors in fits
  - print fit params on plots

- mono_autofocus_firstorder
  ==> GET FINAL GAUSSIAN FIT TO WORK WHEN TAKING DATA FROM EXS_OPAL <===
      ==> MORE SPECIFICALLY HAVE GAUSSIAN FIT BE MORE ROBUST IF NAN
      ==>  APPEAR IN DATA 
  - allow option of parsing a config file 
  - allow threshold for Gas Detector drop shot counting to be set 
  - check number of projections can be set
  - switch for simulation mode
  - set colour and add legend
  - set axes titles and units
  - allow errors to be plotted 
  - propagate errors in fits
  - print fit params on plots
