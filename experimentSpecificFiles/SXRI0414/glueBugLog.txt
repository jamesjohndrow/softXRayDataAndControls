1) ipython terminal doesn't appear on startup
2) some times saves corrupted glue file. Glue files can only be opened from the bash command line. one at work start, but home one has problems.  It's the mismatched lengths in the h5 file. glue catches it on the first import and not when loading the glue file.  Changing the h5 length after the bad import allows for import, but the data is mislabelled.
3) file export isn't reliable.  had to save as LaTEX table and use sed replacement.
