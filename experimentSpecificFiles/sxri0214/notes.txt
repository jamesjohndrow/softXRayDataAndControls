ioan, yes sorry! run 149. typo. She had a few plots looking at it
differently, but I believe that was the most promising.

I would say slides 7,15, or 17? Red and blue are laser on and off (or
maybe off and on).

These plot the intensity of the APD, so taking the pulse and
subtracting the background, etc. and plotting it with a motor that
represents the angle theta of the sample. The motor pv name is in the
attached screen shot, along with what it looked like on the on-line
monitoring, in the top left panel (this also shows the acq channel
trace).

To get blue and red, both sets are in the same data file but a
differentiated by a chopper. To get that info, to separate the blue
from the red, the signal is fed into another acquiris, so for this, it
is ACQ02, input 2. This gives you a 0 or 1, for laser on or off, well
actually it is  0.04 or 0.31, but same idea. The output of that
channel, should tell us if we have a laser hitting the sample or not.

Thanks a lot,

Josh

Hi Josh,

Just getting started on this. Few questions first.

1) does "file 49" in the email below mean "run 149"?

2) which graph (i.e. on what number slide) linked to in the email below best shows the difference between laser on and laser off?

3) what are the label for the axes in that graph?

Best,
-s


Sioan, here is the rough analysis that Libby has done for i0214. file
49 was the one that got me interested in if we see a difference
between laser on and laser off!
